# Changelog

All notable changes to GBrain will be documented in this file.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-04-17

### Security — Wave 3 (9 vulnerabilities closed)

This wave closes a high-severity arbitrary-file-read in `file_upload`, fixes a fake trust boundary that let any cwd-local recipe execute arbitrary commands, and lays down real SSRF defense for HTTP health checks. If you ran `gbrain` in a directory where someone could drop a `recipes/` folder, this matters.

- **Arbitrary file read via `file_upload` is closed.** Remote (MCP) callers were able to read `/etc/passwd` or any other host file. Path validation now uses `realpathSync` + `path.relative` to catch symlinked-parent traversal, plus an allowlist regex for slugs and filenames (control chars, backslashes, RTL-override Unicode all rejected). Local CLI users still upload from anywhere — only remote callers are confined. Fixes Issue #139, contributed by @Hybirdss; original fix #105 by @garagon.
- **Recipe trust boundary is real now.** `loadAllRecipes()` previously marked every recipe as `embedded=true`, including ones from `./recipes/` in your cwd or `$GBRAIN_RECIPES_DIR`. Anyone who could drop a recipe in cwd could bypass every health-check gate. Now only package-bundled recipes (source install + global install) are trusted. Original fixes #106, #108 by @garagon.
- **String health_checks blocked for untrusted recipes.** Even with the recipe trust fix, the string health_check path ran `execSync` before reaching the typed-DSL switch — a malicious "embedded" recipe could `curl http://169.254.169.254/metadata` and exfiltrate cloud credentials. Non-embedded recipes are now hard-blocked from string health_checks; embedded recipes still get the `isUnsafeHealthCheck` defense-in-depth guard.
- **SSRF defense for HTTP health_checks.** New `isInternalUrl()` blocks loopback, RFC1918, link-local (incl. AWS metadata 169.254.169.254), CGNAT, IPv6 loopback, and IPv4-mapped IPv6 (`[::ffff:127.0.0.1]` canonicalized to hex hextets — both forms blocked). Bypass encodings handled: hex IPs (`0x7f000001`), octal (`0177.0.0.1`), single decimal (`2130706433`). Scheme allowlist rejects `file:`, `data:`, `blob:`, `ftp:`, `javascript:`. `fetch` runs with `redirect: 'manual'` and re-validates every Location header up to 3 hops. Original fix #108 by @garagon.
- **Prompt injection hardening for query expansion.** Restructured the LLM prompt with a system instruction that declares the query as untrusted data, plus an XML-tagged `<user_query>` boundary. Layered with regex sanitization (strips code fences, tags, injection prefixes) and output-side validation on the model's `alternative_queries` array (cap length, strip control chars, dedup, drop empties). The `console.warn` on stripped content never logs the query text itself. Original fix #107 by @garagon.
- **`list_pages` and `get_ingest_log` actually cap now.** Wave 3 found that `clampSearchLimit(limit, default)` was always allowing up to 100 — the second arg was the default, not the cap. Added a third `cap` parameter so `list_pages` caps at 100 and `get_ingest_log` caps at 50. Internal bulk commands (embed --all, export, migrate-engine) bypass the operation layer entirely and remain uncapped. Original fix #109 by @garagon.

### Added

- `OperationContext.remote` flag distinguishes trusted local CLI callers from untrusted MCP callers. Security-sensitive operations (currently `file_upload`) tighten their behavior when `remote=true`. Defaults to strict (treat as remote) when unset.
- Exported security helpers for testing and reuse: `validateUploadPath`, `validatePageSlug`, `validateFilename`, `parseOctet`, `hostnameToOctets`, `isPrivateIpv4`, `isInternalUrl`, `getRecipeDirs`, `sanitizeQueryForPrompt`, `sanitizeExpansionOutput`.
- 49 new tests covering symlink traversal, scheme allowlist, IPv4 bypass forms, IPv6 mapped addresses, prompt injection patterns, and recipe trust boundaries. Plus an E2E regression proving remote callers can't escape cwd.

### Contributors

Wave 3 fixes were contributed by **@garagon** (PRs #105-#109) and **@Hybirdss** (Issue #139). The collector branch re-implemented each fix with additional hardening for the residuals Codex caught during outside-voice review (parent-symlink traversal, fake `isEmbedded` boundary, redirect-following SSRF, scheme bypasses, `clampSearchLimit` semantics).

## [0.10.1] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed

- **`gbrain sync --watch` actually works now.** The watch loop existed but was never called because the CLI routed sync through the operation layer (single-pass only). Now sync routes through the CLI path that knows about `--watch` and `--interval`. Your cron workaround is no longer needed.

- **Sync auto-embeds your pages.** After syncing, gbrain now embeds the changed pages automatically. No more "I synced but search can't find my new page." Opt out with `--no-embed`. Large syncs (100+ pages) defer embedding to `gbrain embed --stale`.

- **First sync no longer repeats forever.** `performFullSync` wasn't saving its checkpoint. Fixed: sync state persists after full import so the next sync is incremental.

- **`dead_links` metric is consistent across engines.** Postgres was counting empty-content chunks instead of dangling links. Now both engines count the same thing: links pointing to non-existent pages.

- **Doctor recommends the right embed command.** Was suggesting `gbrain embed refresh` (doesn't exist). Now correctly says `gbrain embed --stale`.

### Added

- **`gbrain extract links|timeline|all`** builds your link graph and structured timeline from existing markdown. Scans for markdown links, frontmatter fields (company, investors, attendees), and See Also sections. Infers link types from directory structure. Parses both bullet (`- **YYYY-MM-DD** | Source — Summary`) and header (`### YYYY-MM-DD — Title`) timeline formats. Runs automatically after every sync.

- **`gbrain features --json --auto-fix`** scans your brain and tells you what you're not using, with your own numbers. Priority 1 (data quality): missing embeddings, dead links. Priority 2 (unused features): zero links, zero timeline, low coverage, unconfigured integrations. Agents run `--auto-fix` to handle everything automatically.

- **`gbrain autopilot --install`** sets up a persistent daemon that runs sync, extract, and embed in a continuous loop. Health-based scheduling: brain score >= 90 slows down, < 70 speeds up. Installs as a launchd service (macOS) or crontab entry (Linux). One command, brain maintains itself forever.

- **Brain health score (0-100)** in `gbrain health` and `gbrain doctor`. Weighted composite of embed coverage, link density, timeline coverage, orphan pages, and dead links. Agents use it as a health gate.

- **`gbrain embed --slugs`** embeds specific pages by slug. Used internally by sync auto-embed to target just the changed pages.

- **Instruction layer for agents.** RESOLVER.md routing entries, maintain skill sections, and setup skill phase for extract, features, and autopilot. Without these, agents would never discover the new commands.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- **Your agent now has 24 skills, not 8.** 16 new brain skills generalized from a production deployment with 14,700+ pages. Signal detection, brain-first lookup, content ingestion (articles, video, meetings), entity enrichment, task management, cron scheduling, reports, and cross-modal review. All shipped as fat markdown files your agent reads on demand.

- **Signal detector fires on every message.** A cheap sub-agent spawns in parallel to capture original thinking and entity mentions. Ideas get preserved with exact phrasing. Entities get brain pages. The brain compounds on autopilot.

- **RESOLVER.md routes your agent to the right skill.** Modeled on a 215-line production dispatcher. Categorized routing table: always-on, brain ops, ingestion, thinking, operational. Your agent reads it, matches the user's intent, loads the skill. No slash commands needed.

- **Soul-audit builds your agent's identity.** 6-phase interactive interview generates SOUL.md (who the agent is), USER.md (who you are), ACCESS_POLICY.md (who sees what), and HEARTBEAT.md (operational cadence). Re-runnable anytime. Ships with minimal defaults so first boot is instant.

- **Access control out of the box.** 4-tier privacy policy (Full/Work/Family/None) enforced by skill instructions before every response. Template-based, configurable per user.

- **Conventions directory codifies operational discipline.** Brain-first lookup protocol, citation quality standards, model routing table, test-before-bulk rule, and cross-modal review pairs. These are the hard-won patterns that prevent bad bulk runs and silent failures.

- **`gbrain init` detects GStack and reports mod status.** After brain setup, init now shows how many skills are loaded, whether GStack is installed, and where to get it. GStack detection uses `gstack-global-discover` with fallback to known host paths.

- **Conformance standard for all skills.** Every skill now has YAML frontmatter (name, version, description, triggers, tools, mutating) plus Contract, Anti-Patterns, and Output Format sections. Two new test files validate conformance across all 25 skills.

- **Existing 8 skills migrated to conformance format.** Frontmatter added, Workflow renamed to Phases, Contract and Anti-Patterns sections added. Ingest becomes a thin router delegating to specialized ingestion skills.

### The 16 new skills

| Skill | What it does | Why it matters |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **signal-detector** | Fires on every message. Spawns a cheap model in parallel to capture original thinking and entity mentions. | Your brain compounds on autopilot. Every conversation is an ingest event. Miss a signal and the brain never learns it. |
| **brain-ops** | Brain-first lookup before any external API. The read-enrich-write loop that makes every response smarter. | Without this, your agent reaches for Google when the answer is already in the brain. Wastes tokens, misses context. |
| **idea-ingest** | Links, articles, tweets go into the brain with analysis, author people pages, and cross-linking. | Every article worth reading is worth remembering. The author gets a people page. The ideas get cross-linked to what you already know. |
| **media-ingest** | Video, audio, PDF, books, screenshots, GitHub repos. Transcripts, entity extraction, backlink propagation. | One skill handles every media format. Absorbs what used to be 3 separate skills (video-ingest, youtube-ingest, book-ingest). |
| **meeting-ingestion** | Transcripts become brain pages. Every attendee gets enriched. Every company discussed gets a timeline entry. | A meeting is NOT fully ingested until every entity is propagated. This is the skill that turns a transcript into 10 updated brain pages. |
| **citation-fixer** | Scans brain pages for missing or malformed `[Source: ...]` citations. Fixes formatting to match the standard. | Without citations, you can't trace facts back to where they came from. Six months later, "who said this?" has an answer. |
| **repo-architecture** | Where new brain files go. Decision protocol: primary subject determines directory, not format or source. | Prevents the #1 misfiling pattern: dumping everything in `sources/` because it came from a URL. |
| **skill-creator** | Create new skills following the conformance standard. MECE check against existing skills. Updates manifest and resolver. | Users who need a capability GBrain doesn't have can create it themselves. The skill teaches the agent how to extend itself. |
| **daily-task-manager** | Add, complete, defer, remove, review tasks with priority levels (P0-P3). Stored as a searchable brain page. | Your tasks live in the brain, not a separate app. The agent can cross-reference tasks with meeting notes and people pages. |
| **daily-task-prep** | Morning preparation. Calendar lookahead with brain context per attendee, open threads from yesterday, active task review. | Walk into every meeting with full context on every person in the room, automatically. |
| **cross-modal-review** | Spawn a different AI model to review the agent's work before committing. Refusal routing: if one model refuses, silently switch. | Two models agreeing is stronger signal than one model being thorough. Refusal routing means the user never sees "I can't do that." |
| **cron-scheduler** | Schedule staggering (5-min offsets), quiet hours (timezone-aware with wake-up override), thin job prompts. | 21 cron jobs at :00 is a thundering herd. Staggering prevents it. Quiet hours mean no 3 AM notifications. Wake-up override releases the backlog. |
| **reports** | Timestamped reports with keyword routing. "What's the latest briefing?" maps to the right report directory. | Cheap replacement for vector search on frequent queries. Don't embed. Load the file. |
| **testing** | Validates every skill has SKILL.md with frontmatter, manifest coverage, resolver coverage. The CI for your skill system. | 3 skills and you need validation. 24 skills and you need it yesterday. Catches dead references, missing sections, MECE violations. |
| **soul-audit** | 6-phase interview that generates SOUL.md, USER.md, ACCESS_POLICY.md, HEARTBEAT.md. Your agent's identity, built from your answers. | What makes Wintermute feel like Wintermute. Without personality and access control, every agent feels the same. |
| **webhook-transforms** | External events (SMS, meetings, social mentions) converted into brain pages with entity extraction. Dead-letter queue for failures. | Your brain ingests signals from everywhere. Not just conversations, but every webhook, every notification, every external event. |

### Infrastructure (new in v0.10.0)

- **Your brain now self-validates its own skill routing.** `checkResolvable()` verifies every skill is reachable from RESOLVER.md, detects MECE overlaps, flags missing triggers, and catches DRY violations. Runs from `bun test`, `gbrain doctor`, and the skill-creator skill. Every issue comes with a machine-readable fix object the agent can act on.

- **`gbrain doctor` got serious.** 8 health checks now (up from 5), plus a composite health score (0-100). Filesystem checks (resolver, conformance) run even without a database. `--fast` skips DB checks. `--json` output includes structured `issues` array with action strings so agents can parse and auto-fix.

- **Batch operations won't melt your machine anymore.** Adaptive load-aware throttling checks CPU and memory before each batch item. Exponential backoff with a 20-attempt safety cap. Active hours multiplier slows batch work during the day. Two concurrent batch process limit.

- **Your agent's classifiers get smarter automatically.** Fail-improve loop: try deterministic code first, fall back to LLM, log every fallback. Over time, the logs reveal which regex patterns are missing. Auto-generates test cases from successful LLM results. Tracks deterministic hit rate in `gbrain doctor` output.

- **Voice notes just work.** Groq Whisper transcription (with OpenAI fallback) via `transcribe_audio` operation. Files over 25MB get ffmpeg-segmented automatically. Transcripts flow through the standard import pipeline, entities get extracted, back-links get created.

- **Enrichment is now a global service, not a per-skill skill.** Every ingest pathway can call `extractAndEnrich()` to detect entities and create/update their brain pages. Tier auto-escalation: entities start at Tier 3, auto-promote to Tier 1 based on mention frequency across sources.

- **Data research: one skill for any email-to-tracker pipeline.** New `data-research` skill with parameterized YAML recipes. Extract investor updates (MRR, ARR, runway, headcount), expense receipts, company metrics from email. Battle-tested regex patterns, extraction integrity rule (save first, report second), dedup with configurable tolerance, canonical tracker pages with running totals.

### For contributors

- `test/skills-conformance.test.ts` validates every skill has valid frontmatter and required sections
- `test/resolver.test.ts` validates RESOLVER.md coverage and routing consistency
- `skills/manifest.json` now has `conformance_version` field and lists all 24 skills
- Identity templates in `templates/` (SOUL.md, USER.md, ACCESS_POLICY.md, HEARTBEAT.md)
## [0.9.3] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Search understands what you're asking. +21% page coverage, +29% signal, 100% source accuracy.** A zero-latency intent classifier reads your query and picks the right search mode. "Who is Alice?" surfaces your compiled truth assessment. "When did we last meet?" surfaces timeline entries with dates. No LLM call, just pattern matching. Your agent sees 8.7 relevant pages per query instead of 7.2, and two thirds of returned chunks are now distilled assessments instead of half. Entity lookups always lead with compiled truth. Temporal queries always find the dates. Benchmarked against 29 pages, 20 queries with graded relevance (run `bun run test/benchmark-search-quality.ts` to reproduce). Inspired by Ramp Labs' "Latent Briefing" paper (April 2026).
- **`gbrain query --detail low/medium/high`.** Agents can control how deep search goes. `low` returns compiled truth only. `medium` (default) returns everything with dedup. `high` returns all chunks uncapped. Auto-escalates from low to high if no results found. MCP picks it up automatically.
- **`gbrain eval` measures search quality.** Full retrieval evaluation harness with P@k, R@k, MRR, nDCG@k metrics. A/B comparison mode for parameter tuning: `gbrain eval --qrels queries.json --config-a baseline.json --config-b boosted.json`. Contributed by @4shut0sh.
- **CJK queries expand correctly.** Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text was silently skipping query expansion because word count used space-delimited splitting. Now counts characters for CJK. Contributed by @YIING99.
- **Health checks speak a typed language now.** Recipe `health_checks` use a typed DSL (`http`, `env_exists`, `command`, `any_of`) instead of raw shell strings. No more `execSync(untrustedYAML)`. Your agent runs `gbrain integrations doctor` and gets structured results, not shell injection risk. All 7 first-party recipes migrated. String health checks still work (with deprecation warning) for backward compat.

### Fixed

- **Your storage backend can't be tricked into reading `/etc/passwd`.** `LocalStorage` now validates every path stays within the storage root. `../../etc/passwd` gets "Path traversal blocked" instead of your system files. All 6 methods covered (upload, download, delete, exists, list, getUrl).
- **MCP callers can't read arbitrary files via `file_url`.** `resolveFile()` now validates the requested path stays within the brain root before touching the filesystem. Previously, `../../etc/passwd` would read any file the process could access.
- **`.supabase` marker files can't escape their scope.** Marker prefix validation now rejects `../`, absolute paths, and bare `..`. A crafted `.supabase` file in a shared brain repo can't make storage requests outside the intended prefix.
- **File queries can't blow up memory.** The slug-filtered `file_list` MCP operation now has the same `LIMIT 100` as the unfiltered branch. Also fixed the CLI `gbrain files list` and `gbrain files verify` commands.
- **Symlinks in brain directories can't exfiltrate files.** All 4 file walkers in `files.ts` plus the `init.ts` size counter now use `lstatSync` and skip symlinks. Broken symlinks and `node_modules` directories are also skipped.
- **Recipe health checks can't inject shell commands.** Non-embedded (user-created) recipes with shell metacharacters in health_check strings are blocked. First-party recipes are trusted but migrated to the typed DSL.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- **Fresh local installs initialize cleanly again.** `gbrain init` now creates the local PGLite data directory before taking its advisory lock, so first-run setup no longer misreports a missing directory as a lock timeout.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- **Your brain can't be poisoned by rogue frontmatter anymore.** Slug authority is now path-derived. A file at `notes/random.md` can't declare `slug: people/admin` and silently overwrite someone else's page. Mismatches are rejected with a clear error telling you exactly what to fix.
- **Symlinks in your notes directory can't exfiltrate files.** The import walker now uses `lstatSync` and refuses to follow symlinks, blocking the attack where a contributor plants a link to `~/.zshrc` in the brain directory. Defense-in-depth: `importFromFile` itself also checks.
- **Giant payloads through MCP can't rack up your OpenAI bill.** `importFromContent` now checks `Buffer.byteLength` before any processing. 10 MB of emoji through `put_page`? Rejected before chunking starts.
- **Search can't be weaponized into a DoS.** `limit` is clamped to 100 across all search paths (keyword, vector, hybrid). `statement_timeout: 8s` on the Postgres connection as defense-in-depth. Requesting `limit: 10000000` now gets you 100 results and a warning.
- **PGLite stops crashing when two processes touch the same brain.** File-based advisory lock using atomic `mkdir` with PID tracking and 5-minute stale detection. Clear error messages tell you which process holds the lock and how to recover.
- **12 data integrity fixes landed.** Orphan chunks cleaned up on empty pages. Write operations (`addLink`, `addTag`, `addTimelineEntry`, `putRawData`, `createVersion`) now throw when the target page doesn't exist instead of silently no-opping. Health metrics (`stale_pages`, `dead_links`, `orphan_pages`) now measure real problems instead of always returning 0. Keyword search moved from JS-side sort-and-splice to a SQL CTE with `LIMIT`. MCP server validates params before dispatch.
- **Stale embeddings can't lie to you anymore.** When chunk text changes but embedding fails, the old vector is now NULL'd out instead of preserved. Previously, search could return results based on outdated vectors attached to new text.
- **Embedding failures are no longer silent.** The `catch { /* non-fatal */ }` is gone. You now get `[gbrain] embedding failed for slug (N chunks): error message` in stderr. Still non-fatal, but you know what happened.
- **O(n^2) chunk lookup in `embedPage` is gone.** Replaced `find() + indexOf()` with a single `Map` lookup. Matches the pattern `embedAll` already uses.
- **Stdin bombs blocked.** `parseOpArgs` now caps stdin at 5 MB before the full buffer is consumed.

### Added

- **`gbrain embed --all` is 30x faster.** Sliding worker pool with 20 concurrent workers (tunable via `GBRAIN_EMBED_CONCURRENCY`). A 20,000-chunk corpus that took 2.5 hours now finishes in ~8 minutes.
- **Search pagination.** Both `search` and `query` now accept `--offset` for paginating through results. Combined with the 100-result ceiling, you can now page through large result sets.
- **`gbrain ask` is an alias for `gbrain query`.** CLI-only, doesn't appear in MCP tools-json.
- **Content hash now covers all page fields.** Title, type, and frontmatter changes trigger re-import. First sync after upgrade will re-import all pages (one-time, expected).
- **Migration file for v0.9.1.** Auto-update agent knows to expect the full re-import and will run `gbrain embed --all` afterward.
- **`pgcrypto` extension added to schema.** Fallback for `gen_random_uuid()` on Postgres < 13.

### Changed

- **Search type and exclude_slugs filters now work.** These were advertised in the API but never implemented. Both `searchKeyword` and `searchVector` now respect `type` and `exclude_slugs` params.
- **Hybrid search no longer double-embeds the query.** `expandQuery` already includes the original, so we use it directly instead of prepending.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- **Large files don't bloat your git repo anymore.** `gbrain files upload-raw`
  auto-routes by size: text and PDFs under 100 MB stay in git, everything larger
  (or any media file) goes to Supabase Storage with a `.redirect.yaml` pointer
  left in the repo. Files over 100 MB use TUS resumable upload (6 MB chunks with
  retry and backoff) so a flaky connection doesn't lose a 2 GB video upload.
  `gbrain files signed-url` generates 1-hour access links for private buckets.

- **The full file migration lifecycle works end to end.** `mirror` uploads to
  cloud and keeps local copies. `redirect` replaces local files with
  `.redirect.yaml` pointers (verifies remote exists first, won't delete data).
  `restore` downloads back from cloud. `clean` removes pointers when you're sure.
  `status` shows where you are. Three states, zero data loss risk.

- **Your brain now enforces its own graph integrity.** The Iron Law of Back-Linking
  is mandatory across all skills. Every mention of a person or company creates
  a bidirectional link. This transforms your brain from a flat file store into a
  traversable knowledge graph.

- **Filing rules prevent the #1 brain mistake.** New `skills/_brain-filing-rules.md`
  stops the most common error: dumping everything into `sources/`. File by primary
  subject, not format. Includes notability gate and citation requirements.

- **Enrichment protocol that actually works.** Rewritten from a 46-line API list to
  a 7-step pipeline with 3-tier system, person/company page templates, pluggable
  data sources, validation rules, and bulk enrichment safety.

- **Ingest handles everything.** Articles, videos, podcasts, PDFs, screenshots,
  meeting transcripts, social media. Each with a workflow that uses real gbrain
  commands (`upload-raw`, `signed-url`) instead of theoretical patterns.

- **Citation requirements across all skills.** Every fact needs inline
  `[Source: ...]` citations. Three formats, source precedence hierarchy.

- **Maintain skill catches what you missed.** Back-link enforcement, citation audit,
  filing violations, file storage health checks, benchmark testing.

- **Voice calls don't crash on em dashes anymore.** Unicode sanitization for Twilio
  WebSocket, PII scrub, identity-first prompt, DIY STT+LLM+TTS pipeline option,
  Smart VAD default, auto-upload call audio via `gbrain files upload-raw`.

- **X-to-Brain gets eyes.** Image OCR, Filtered Stream real-time monitoring,
  6-dimension tweet rating rubric, outbound tweet monitoring, cron staggering.

- **Share brain pages without exposing the brain.** `gbrain publish` generates
  beautiful, self-contained HTML from any brain page. Strips private data
  (frontmatter, citations, confirmations, brain links, timeline) automatically.
  Optional AES-256-GCM password gate with client-side decryption, no server
  needed. Dark/light mode, mobile-optimized typography. This is the first
  code+skill pair: deterministic code does the work, the skill tells the agent
  when and how. See the [Thin Harness, Fat Skills](https://x.com/garrytan/status/2042925773300908103)
  thread for the architecture philosophy.

### Changed

- **Supabase Storage** now auto-selects upload method by file size: standard POST
  for < 100 MB, TUS resumable for >= 100 MB. Signed URL generation for private
  bucket access (1-hour expiry).
- **File resolver** supports both `.redirect.yaml` (v0.9+) and legacy `.redirect`
  (v0.8) formats for backward compatibility.
- **Redirect format** upgraded from `.redirect` (5 fields) to `.redirect.yaml`
  (10 fields: target, bucket, storage_path, size, size_human, hash, mime,
  uploaded, source_url, type).
- **All skills** updated to reference actual `gbrain files` commands instead of
  theoretical patterns.
- **Back-link enforcer closes the loop.** `gbrain check-backlinks check` scans your
  brain for entity mentions without back-links. `gbrain check-backlinks fix` creates
  them. The Iron Law of Back-Linking is in every skill, now the code enforces it.

- **Page linter catches LLM slop.** `gbrain lint` flags "Of course! Here is..."
  preambles, wrapping code fences, placeholder dates, missing frontmatter, broken
  citations, and empty sections. `gbrain lint --fix` auto-strips the fixable ones.
  Every brain that uses AI for ingestion accumulates this. Now it's one command.

- **Audit trail for everything.** `gbrain report --type enrichment-sweep` saves
  timestamped reports to `brain/reports/{type}/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md`. The maintain
  skill references this for enrichment sweeps, meeting syncs, and maintenance runs.

- **Publish skill** added to manifest (8th skill). First code+skill pair.
- Skills version bumped to 0.9.0.
- 67 new unit tests across publish, backlinks, lint, and report. Total: 409 pass.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- **Your AI can answer the phone now.** Voice-to-brain v0.8.0 ships 25 production patterns from a real deployment. WebRTC works in a browser tab with just an OpenAI key, phone number via Twilio is optional. Your agent picks its own name and personality. Pre-computed engagement bids mean it greets you with something specific ("dude, your social radar caught something wild today"), not "how can I help you?" Context-first prompts, proactive advisor mode, caller routing, dynamic noise suppression, stuck watchdog, thinking sounds during tool calls. This is the "Her" experience, out of the box.
- **Upgrade = feature discovery.** When you upgrade to v0.8.0, the CLI tells you what's new and your agent offers to set up voice immediately. WebRTC-first (zero setup), then asks about a phone number. Migration files now have YAML frontmatter with `feature_pitch` so every future version can pitch its headline feature through the upgrade flow.
- **Remote MCP simplified.** The Supabase Edge Function deployment is gone. Remote MCP now uses a self-hosted server + ngrok tunnel. Simpler, more reliable, works with any AI client. All `docs/mcp/` guides updated to reflect the actual production architecture.

### Changed

- **Voice recipe is now 25 production patterns deep.** Identity separation, pre-computed bid system, context-first prompts, proactive advisor mode, conversation timing (the #1 fix), no-repetition rule, radical prompt compression (13K to 4.7K tokens), OpenAI Realtime Prompting Guide structure, auth-before-speech, brain escalation, stuck watchdog, never-hang-up rule, thinking sounds, fallback TwiML, tool set architecture, trusted user auth, caller routing, dynamic VAD, on-screen debug UI, live moment capture, belt-and-suspenders post-call, mandatory 3-step post-call, WebRTC parity, dual API event handling, report-aware query routing.
- **WebRTC session pseudocode updated.** Native FormData, `tools` in session config, `type: 'realtime'` on all session.update calls. WebRTC transcription NOT supported over data channel (use Whisper post-call).
- **MCP docs rewritten.** All per-client guides (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cowork, Perplexity) updated from Edge Function URLs to self-hosted + ngrok pattern.

### Removed

- **Supabase Edge Function MCP deployment.** `scripts/deploy-remote.sh`, `supabase/functions/gbrain-mcp/`, `src/edge-entry.ts`, `.env.production.example`, `docs/mcp/CHATGPT.md` all removed. The Edge Function never worked reliably. Self-hosted + ngrok is the path.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- **Your brain now runs locally with zero infrastructure.** PGLite (Postgres 17.5 compiled to WASM) gives you the exact same search quality as Supabase, same pgvector HNSW, same pg_trgm fuzzy matching, same tsvector full-text search. No server, no subscription, no API keys needed for keyword search. `gbrain init` and you're running in 2 seconds.
- **Smart init defaults to local.** `gbrain init` now creates a PGLite brain by default. If your repo has 1000+ markdown files, it suggests Supabase for scale. `--supabase` and `--pglite` flags let you choose explicitly.
- **Migrate between engines anytime.** `gbrain migrate --to supabase` transfers your entire brain (pages, chunks, embeddings, tags, links, timeline) to remote Postgres with manifest-based resume. `gbrain migrate --to pglite` goes the other way. Embeddings copy directly, no re-embedding needed.
- **Pluggable engine factory.** `createEngine()` dynamically loads the right engine from config. PGLite WASM is never loaded for Postgres users.
- **Search works without OpenAI.** `hybridSearch` now checks for `OPENAI_API_KEY` before attempting embeddings. No key = keyword-only search. No more crashes when you just want to search your local brain.
- **Your brain gets new senses automatically.** Integration recipes teach your agent how to wire up voice calls, email, Twitter, and calendar into your brain. Run `gbrain integrations` to see what's available. Your agent reads the recipe, asks for API keys, validates each one, and sets everything up. Markdown is code -- the recipe IS the installer.
- **Voice-to-brain: phone calls create brain pages.** The first recipe: Twilio + OpenAI Realtime voice agent. Call a number, talk, and a structured brain page appears with entity detection, cross-references, and a summary posted to your messaging app. Opinionated defaults: caller screening, brain-first lookup, quiet hours, thinking sounds. The smoke test calls YOU (outbound) so you experience the magic immediately.
- **`gbrain integrations` command.** Six subcommands for managing integration recipes: `list` (dashboard of senses + reflexes), `show` (recipe details), `status` (credential checks with direct links to get missing keys), `doctor` (health checks), `stats` (signal analytics), `test` (recipe validation). `--json` on every subcommand for agent-parseable output. No database connection needed.
- **Health heartbeat.** Integrations log events to `~/.gbrain/integrations/<id>/heartbeat.jsonl`. Status checks detect stale integrations and include diagnostic steps.
- **17 individually linkable SKILLPACK guides.** The 1,281-line monolith is now broken into standalone guides at `docs/guides/`, organized by category. Each guide is individually searchable and linkable. The SKILLPACK index stays at the same URL (backward compatible).
- **"Getting Data In" documentation.** New `docs/integrations/` with a landing page, recipe format documentation, credential gateway guide, and meeting webhook guide. Explains the deterministic collector pattern: code for data, LLMs for judgment.
- **Architecture and philosophy docs.** `docs/architecture/infra-layer.md` documents the shared foundation (import, chunk, embed, search). `docs/ethos/THIN_HARNESS_FAT_SKILLS.md` is Garry's essay on the architecture philosophy with an agent decision guide. `docs/designs/HOMEBREW_FOR_PERSONAL_AI.md` maps the 10-star vision.

### Changed

- **Engine interface expanded.** Added `runMigration()` (replaces internal driver access for schema migrations) and `getChunksWithEmbeddings()` (loads embedding data for cross-engine migration).
- **Shared utilities extracted.** `validateSlug`, `contentHash`, and row mappers moved from `postgres-engine.ts` to `src/core/utils.ts`. Both engines share them.
- **Config infers engine type.** If `database_path` is set but `engine` is missing, config now infers `pglite` instead of defaulting to `postgres`.
- **Import serializes on PGLite.** Parallel workers are Postgres-only. PGLite uses sequential import (single-connection architecture).

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed

- **Import no longer silently drops files with "..." in the name.** The path traversal check rejected any filename containing two consecutive dots, killing 1.2% of files in real-world corpora (YouTube transcripts, TED talks, podcast titles). Now only rejects actual traversal patterns like `../`. Community fix wave, 8 contributors.
- **Import no longer crashes on JavaScript/TypeScript projects.** The file walker crashed on `node_modules` directories and broken symlinks. Now skips `node_modules` and handles broken symlinks gracefully with a warning.
- **`gbrain init` exits cleanly after setup.** Previously hung forever because stdin stayed open. Now pauses stdin after reading input.
- **pgvector extension auto-created during init.** No more copy-pasting SQL into the Supabase editor. `gbrain init` now runs `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector` automatically, with a clear fallback message if it can't.
- **Supabase connection string hint matches current dashboard UI.** Updated navigation path to match the 2026 Supabase dashboard layout.
- **Hermes Agent link fixed in README.** Pointed to the correct NousResearch GitHub repo.

### Changed

- **Search is faster.** Keyword search now runs in parallel with the embedding pipeline instead of waiting for it. Saves ~200-500ms per hybrid search call.
- **.mdx files are now importable.** The import walker, sync filter, and slug generator all recognize `.mdx` alongside `.md`.

### Added

- **Community PR wave process** documented in CLAUDE.md for future contributor batches.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- **Access your brain from any AI client.** Deploy GBrain as a serverless remote MCP endpoint on your existing Supabase instance. Works with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cowork, and Perplexity Computer. One URL, bearer token auth, zero new infrastructure. Clone the repo, fill in 3 env vars, run `scripts/deploy-remote.sh`, done.
- **Per-client setup guides** in `docs/mcp/` for Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cowork, Perplexity, and ChatGPT (coming soon, requires OAuth 2.1). Also documents Tailscale Funnel and ngrok as self-hosted alternatives.
- **Token management** via standalone `src/commands/auth.ts`. Create, list, revoke per-client bearer tokens. Includes smoke test: `auth.ts test <url> --token <token>` verifies the full pipeline (initialize + tools/list + get_stats) in 3 seconds.
- **Usage logging** via `mcp_request_log` table. Every remote tool call logs token name, operation, latency, and status for debugging and security auditing.
- **Hardened health endpoint** at `/health`. Unauthenticated: 200/503 only (no info disclosure). Authenticated: checks postgres, pgvector, and OpenAI API key status.

### Fixed

- **MCP server actually connects now.** Handler registration used string literals (`'tools/list' as any`) instead of SDK typed schemas. Replaced with `ListToolsRequestSchema` and `CallToolRequestSchema`. Without this fix, `gbrain serve` silently failed to register handlers. (Issue #9)
- **Search results no longer flooded by one large page.** Keyword search returned ALL chunks from matching pages. Now returns one best chunk per page via `DISTINCT ON`. (Issue #22)
- **Search dedup no longer collapses to one chunk per page.** Layer 1 kept only the single highest-scoring chunk per slug. Now keeps top 3, letting later dedup layers (text similarity, cap per page) do their job. (Issue #22)
- **Transactions no longer corrupt shared state.** Both `PostgresEngine.transaction()` and `db.withTransaction()` swapped the shared connection reference, breaking under concurrent use. Now uses scoped engine via `Object.create` with no shared state mutation. (Issue #22)
- **embed --stale no longer wipes valid embeddings.** `upsertChunks()` deleted all chunks then re-inserted, writing NULL for chunks without new embeddings. Now uses UPSERT (INSERT ON CONFLICT UPDATE) with COALESCE to preserve existing embeddings. (Issue #22)
- **Slug normalization is consistent.** `pathToSlug()` preserved case while `inferSlug()` lowercased. Now `validateSlug()` enforces lowercase at the validation layer, covering all entry points. (Issue #22)
- **initSchema no longer reads from disk at runtime.** Both schema loaders used `readFileSync` with `import.meta.url`, which broke in compiled binaries and Deno Edge Functions. Schema is now embedded at build time via `scripts/build-schema.sh`. (Issue #22)
- **file_upload actually uploads content.** The operation wrote DB metadata but never called the storage backend. Fixed in all 3 paths (operation, CLI upload, CLI sync) with rollback semantics. (Issue #22)
- **S3 storage backend authenticates requests.** `signedFetch()` was just unsigned `fetch()`. Replaced with `@aws-sdk/client-s3` for proper SigV4 signing. Supports R2/MinIO via `forcePathStyle`. (Issue #22)
- **Parallel import uses thread-safe queue.** `queue.shift()` had race conditions under parallel workers. Now uses an atomic index counter. Checkpoint preserved on errors for safe resume. (Issue #22)
- **redirect verifies remote existence before deleting local files.** Previously deleted local files unconditionally. Now checks storage backend before removing. (Issue #22)
- **`gbrain call` respects dry_run.** `handleToolCall()` hardcoded `dryRun: false`. Now reads from params. (Issue #22)

### Changed

- Added `@aws-sdk/client-s3` as a dependency for authenticated S3 operations.
- Schema migration v2: unique index on `content_chunks(page_id, chunk_index)` for UPSERT support.
- Schema migration v3: `access_tokens` and `mcp_request_log` tables for remote MCP auth.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed

- **Apple Notes and files with spaces just work.** Paths like `Apple Notes/2017-05-03 ohmygreen.md` now auto-slugify to clean slugs (`apple-notes/2017-05-03-ohmygreen`). Spaces become hyphens, parens and special characters are stripped, accented characters normalize to ASCII. All 5,861+ Apple Notes files import cleanly without manual renaming.
- **Existing brains auto-migrate.** On first run after upgrade, a one-time migration renames all existing slugs with spaces or special characters to their clean form. Links are rewritten automatically. No manual cleanup needed.
- **Import and sync produce identical slugs.** Both pipelines now use the same `slugifyPath()` function, eliminating the mismatch where sync preserved case but import lowercased.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- **Your brain never falls behind.** Live sync keeps the vector DB current with your brain repo automatically. Set up a cron, use `--watch`, hook into GitHub webhooks, or use git hooks. Your agent picks whatever fits its environment. Edit a markdown file, push, and within minutes it's searchable. No more stale embeddings serving wrong answers.
- **Know your install actually works.** New verification runbook (`docs/GBRAIN_VERIFY.md`) catches the silent failures that used to go unnoticed: the pooler bug that skips pages, missing embeddings, stale sync. The real test: push a correction, wait, search for it. If the old text comes back, sync is broken and the runbook tells you exactly why.
- **New installs set up live sync automatically.** The setup skill now includes live sync (Phase H) and full verification (Phase I) as mandatory steps. Agents that install GBrain will configure automatic sync and verify it works before declaring setup complete.
- **Fixes the silent page-skip bug.** If your Supabase connection uses the Transaction mode pooler, sync silently skips most pages. The new docs call this out as a hard prerequisite with a clear fix (switch to Session mode). The verification runbook catches it by comparing page count against file count.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-04-10

### Changed

- All GitHub Actions pinned to commit SHAs across test, e2e, and release workflows. Prevents supply chain attacks via mutable version tags.
- Workflow permissions hardened: `contents: read` on test and e2e workflows limits GITHUB_TOKEN blast radius.
- OpenClaw CI install pinned to v2026.4.9 instead of pulling latest.

### Added

- Gitleaks secret scanning CI job runs on every push and PR. Catches accidentally committed API keys, tokens, and credentials.
- `.gitleaks.toml` config with allowlists for test fixtures and example files.
- GitHub Actions SHA maintenance rule in CLAUDE.md so pins stay fresh on every `/ship` and `/review`.
- S3 Sig V4 TODO for future implementation when S3 storage becomes a deployment path.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- `gbrain check-update` command with `--json` output. Checks GitHub Releases for new versions, compares semver (minor+ only, skips patches), fetches and parses changelog diffs. Fail-silent on network errors.
- SKILLPACK Section 17: Auto-Update Notifications. Full agent playbook for the update lifecycle: check, notify, consent, upgrade, skills refresh, schema sync, report. Never auto-upgrades without user permission.
- Standalone SKILLPACK self-update for users who load the skillpack directly without the gbrain CLI. Version markers in SKILLPACK and RECOMMENDED_SCHEMA headers, with raw GitHub URL fetching.
- Step 7 in the OpenClaw install paste: daily update checks, default-on. User opts into being notified about updates, not into automatic installs.
- Setup skill Phase G: conditional auto-update offer for manual install users.
- Schema state tracking via `~/.gbrain/update-state.json`. Tracks which recommended schema directories the user adopted, declined, or added custom. Future upgrades suggest new additions without re-suggesting declined items.
- `skills/migrations/` directory convention for version-specific post-upgrade agent directives.
- 20 unit tests and 5 E2E tests for the check-update command, covering version comparison, changelog extraction, CLI wiring, and real GitHub API interaction.
- E2E test DB lifecycle documentation in CLAUDE.md: spin up, run tests, tear down. No orphaned containers.

### Changed

- `detectInstallMethod()` exported from `upgrade.ts` for reuse by `check-update`.

### Fixed

- Semver comparison in changelog extraction was missing major-version guard, causing incorrect changelog entries to appear when crossing major version boundaries.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- `gbrain doctor` command with `--json` output. Checks pgvector extension, RLS policies, schema version, embedding coverage, and connection health. Agents can self-diagnose issues.
- Pluggable storage backends: S3, Supabase Storage, and local filesystem. Choose where binary files live independently of the database. Configured via `gbrain init` or environment variables.
- Parallel import with per-worker engine instances. Large brain imports now use multiple database connections concurrently instead of a single serial pipeline.
- Import resume checkpoints. If `gbrain import` is interrupted, it picks up where it left off instead of re-importing everything.
- Automatic schema migration runner. On connect, gbrain detects the current schema version and applies any pending migrations without manual intervention.
- Row-Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables with `BYPASSRLS` safety check. Every query goes through RLS policies.
- `--json` flag on `gbrain init` and `gbrain import` for machine-readable output. Agents can parse structured results instead of scraping CLI text.
- File migration CLI (`gbrain files migrate`) for moving files between storage backends. Two-way-door: test with `--dry-run`, migrate incrementally.
- Bulk chunk INSERT for faster page writes. Chunks are inserted in a single statement instead of one-at-a-time.
- Supabase smart URL parsing: automatically detects and converts IPv6-only pooler URLs to the correct connection format.
- 56 new unit tests covering doctor, storage backends, file migration, import resume, slug validation, setup branching, Supabase admin, and YAML parsing. Test suite grew from 9 to 19 test files.
- E2E tests for parallel import concurrency and all new features.

### Fixed

- `validateSlug` now accepts any filename characters (spaces, unicode, special chars) instead of rejecting non-alphanumeric slugs. Apple Notes and other real-world filenames import cleanly.
- Import resilience: files over 5MB are skipped with a warning instead of crashing the pipeline. Errors in individual files no longer abort the entire import.
- `gbrain init` detects IPv6-only Supabase URLs and adds the required `pgvector` check during setup.
- E2E test fixture counts, CLI argument parsing, and doctor exit codes cleaned up.

### Changed

- Setup skill and README rewritten for agent-first developer experience.
- Maintain skill updated with RLS verification, schema health checks, and `nohup` hints for large embedding jobs.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added

- Contract-first architecture: single `operations.ts` defines ~30 shared operations. CLI, MCP, and tools-json all generated from the same source. Zero drift.
- `OperationError` type with structured error codes (`page_not_found`, `invalid_params`, `embedding_failed`, etc.). Agents can self-correct.
- `dry_run` parameter on all mutating operations. Agents preview before committing.
- `importFromContent()` split from `importFile()`. Both share the same chunk+embed+tag pipeline, but `importFromContent` works from strings (used by `put_page`). Wrapped in `engine.transaction()`.
- Idempotency hash now includes ALL fields (title, type, frontmatter, tags), not just compiled_truth + timeline. Metadata-only edits no longer silently skipped.
- `get_page` now supports optional `fuzzy: true` for slug resolution. Returns `resolved_slug` so callers know what happened.
- `query` operation now supports `expand` toggle (default true). Both CLI and MCP get the same control.
- 10 new operations wired up: `put_raw_data`, `get_raw_data`, `resolve_slugs`, `get_chunks`, `log_ingest`, `get_ingest_log`, `file_list`, `file_upload`, `file_url`.
- OpenClaw bundle plugin manifest (`openclaw.plugin.json`) with config schema, MCP server config, and skill listing.
- GitHub Actions CI: test on push/PR, multi-platform release builds (macOS arm64 + Linux x64) on version tags.
- `gbrain init --non-interactive` flag for plugin mode (accepts config via flags/env vars, no TTY required).
- Post-upgrade version verification in `gbrain upgrade`.
- Parity test (`test/parity.test.ts`) verifies structural contract between operations, CLI, and MCP.
- New `setup` skill replacing `install`: auto-provision Supabase via CLI, AGENTS.md injection, target TTHW < 2 min.
- E2E test suite against real Postgres+pgvector. 13 realistic fixtures (miniature brain with people, companies, deals, meetings, concepts), 14 test suites covering all operations, search quality benchmarks, idempotency stress tests, schema validation, and full setup journey verification.
- GitHub Actions E2E workflow: Tier 1 (mechanical) on every PR, Tier 2 (LLM skills via OpenClaw) nightly.
- `docker-compose.test.yml` and `.env.testing.example` for local E2E development.

### Fixed

- Schema loader in `db.ts` broke on PL/pgSQL trigger functions containing semicolons inside `$$` blocks. Replaced per-statement execution with single `conn.unsafe()` call.
- `traverseGraph` query failed with "could not identify equality operator for type json" when using `SELECT DISTINCT` with `json_agg`. Changed to `jsonb_agg`.

### Changed

- `src/mcp/server.ts` rewritten from ~233 to ~80 lines. Tool definitions and dispatch generated from operations[].
- `src/cli.ts` rewritten. Shared operations auto-registered from operations[]. CLI-only commands (init, upgrade, import, export, files, embed) kept as manual registrations.
- `tools-json` output now generated FROM operations[]. Third contract surface eliminated.
- All 7 skills rewritten with tool-agnostic language. Works with both CLI and MCP plugin contexts.
- File schema: `storage_url` column dropped, `storage_path` is the only identifier. URLs generated on demand via `file_url` operation.
- Config loading: env vars (`GBRAIN_DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`) override config file values. Plugin config injected via env vars.

### Removed

- 12 command files migrated to operations.ts: get.ts, put.ts, delete.ts, list.ts, search.ts, query.ts, health.ts, stats.ts, tags.ts, link.ts, timeline.ts, version.ts.
- `storage_url` column from files table.

## [0.2.0.2] - 2026-04-07

### Changed

- Rewrote recommended brain schema doc with expanded architecture: database layer (entity registry, event ledger, fact store, relationship graph) presented as the core architecture, entity identity and deduplication, enrichment source ordering, epistemic discipline rules, worked examples showing full ingestion chains, concurrency guidance, and browser budget. Smoothed language for open-source readability.

## [0.2.0.1] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- Recommended brain schema doc (`docs/GBRAIN_RECOMMENDED_SCHEMA.md`): full MECE directory structure, compiled truth + timeline pages, enrichment pipeline, resolver decision tree, skill architecture, and cron job recommendations. The OpenClaw paste now links to this as step 5.

### Changed

- First-time experience rewritten. "Try it" section shows your own data, not fictional PG essays. OpenClaw paste references the GitHub repo, includes bun install fallback, and has the agent pick a dynamic query based on what it imported.
- Removed all references to `data/kindling/` (a demo corpus directory that never existed).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- You can now keep your brain current with `gbrain sync`, which uses git's own diff machinery to process only what changed. No more 30-second full directory walks when 3 files changed.
- Watch mode (`gbrain sync --watch`) polls for changes and syncs automatically. Set it and forget it.
- Binary file management with `gbrain files` commands (list, upload, sync, verify). Store images, PDFs, and audio in Supabase Storage instead of clogging your git repo.
- Install skill (`skills/install/SKILL.md`) that walks you through setup from scratch, including Supabase CLI magic path for zero-copy-paste onboarding.
- Import and sync now share a checkpoint. Run `gbrain import`, then `gbrain sync`, and it picks up right where import left off. Zero gap.
- Tag reconciliation on reimport. If you remove a tag from your markdown, it actually gets removed from the database now.
- `gbrain config show` redacts database passwords so you can safely share your config.
- `updateSlug` engine method preserves page identity (page_id, chunks, embeddings) across renames. Zero re-embedding cost.
- `sync_brain` MCP tool returns structured results so agents know exactly what changed.
- 20 new sync tests (39 total across 3 test files)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- Pluggable engine interface (`BrainEngine`) with full Postgres + pgvector implementation
- 25+ CLI commands: init, get, put, delete, list, search, query, import, export, embed, stats, health, link/unlink/backlinks/graph, tag/untag/tags, timeline/timeline-add, history/revert, config, upgrade, serve, call
- MCP stdio server with 20 tools mirroring all CLI operations
- 3-tier chunking: recursive (delimiter-aware), semantic (Savitzky-Golay boundary detection), LLM-guided (Claude Haiku topic shifts)
- Hybrid search with Reciprocal Rank Fusion merging vector + keyword results
- Multi-query expansion via Claude Haiku (2 alternative phrasings per query)
- 4-layer dedup pipeline: by source, cosine similarity, type diversity, per-page cap
- OpenAI embedding service (text-embedding-3-large, 1536 dims) with batch support and exponential backoff
- Postgres schema with pgvector HNSW, tsvector (trigger-based, spans timeline_entries), pg_trgm fuzzy slug matching
- Smart slug resolution for reads (fuzzy match via pg_trgm)
- Page version control with snapshot, history, and revert
- Typed links with recursive CTE graph traversal (max depth configurable)
- Brain health dashboard (embed coverage, stale pages, orphans, dead links)
- Stale alert annotations in search results
- Supabase init wizard with CLI auto-provision fallback
- Slug validation to prevent path traversal on export
- 6 fat markdown skills: ingest, query, maintain, enrich, briefing, migrate
- ClawHub manifest for skill distribution
- Full design docs: GBRAIN_V0 spec, pluggable engine architecture, SQLite engine plan
